Build a complete, standalone web application called ‘Seek’ that runs entirely in the browser (no server-side dependencies required after loading) and provides image/audio processing for pranks or creative content. The app must be 100% functional, bug-free, and optimized for modern browsers (Chrome/Firefox/Edge) on desktop/mobile. Use JavaScript/HTML/CSS as the base, with a modern framework like React.js for the UI. Package it as a single deployable web app (e.g., via Replit’s web hosting) that users can access via a URL.
Key requirements:
•  Core Features:
	•  Photo upload and preview: Allow users to upload one photo (JPG/PNG) and display a live preview with effects.
	•  Audio recording/upload: Allow users to record audio via microphone (10-30 seconds) or upload a clip (WAV/MP3), with playback preview.
	•  Face manipulation/effects: Use browser-compatible libraries for real-time face detection and effects (e.g., simple swaps, filters, or animations). Implement using face-api.js (for face detection/recognition on tensorflow.js) or MediaPipe (for face mesh and augmented reality filters). Support one-photo input for basic face overlay or morphing (zero-shot, no training). Apply effects like distortion, color filters, or AR-style masks in real-time via webcam if possible.
	•  Audio processing features: Use Web Audio API for real-time effects (e.g., pitch shift, echo, or voice modulation to mimic cloning). For voice cloning approximation, integrate a lightweight JS library like ResponsiveVoice.js or a WebAssembly-based model (e.g., from Chatterbox 2025 updates) for speech-to-speech transformation from one audio sample. Keep it local where possible; if needed, optionally integrate a free cloud API (e.g., Resemble AI free tier) for better cloning, but make it toggleable.
	•  Integration: Combine photo and audio for ‘prank mode’ – e.g., apply face effects to webcam feed while modulating live audio, and output a shareable video clip (using MediaRecorder API).
•  UI Design: Sleek, contemporary, ‘sick’ interface optimized for pranks/creative use. Use modern design principles:
	•  Dark mode by default with neon accents (e.g., purple/blue gradients).
	•  Smooth animations: Use CSS transitions/GSAP for button hovers, loading spinners, and effect previews (e.g., fade-ins, scale-ups).
	•  Layout: Responsive grid with sidebar for uploads, main canvas for previews, and bottom bar for controls (Start/Stop/Export).
	•  Mobile optimization: Touch-friendly, full-screen mode for previews.
	•  Polished elements: Custom buttons, progress bars, tooltips, and error messages (e.g., ‘Upload a clearer photo for better effects!’).
•  Real-Time Aspects: Low latency (<300ms) for effects; use Web Workers for heavy processing to avoid freezing the UI.
•  Output/Export: Generate and download processed images/videos (with effects applied), or share via link. Include a ‘preview in call’ mode that simulates video call output (e.g., via getUserMedia).
•  Core Technologies (must use these for browser compatibility):
	•  Framework: React.js with hooks for state management.
	•  Face Effects: face-api.js (GitHub: justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) on tensorflow.js for detection/swaps, or MediaPipe (Google’s JS library) for face tracking/filters.
	•  Audio: Web Audio API native, plus Meyda.js for analysis or Wavesurfer.js for visualization.
	•  Voice Approximation: ResponsiveVoice.js for TTS-based modulation, or integrate a WASM port of OpenVoice if available (fallback to simple pitch/effect nodes).
	•  Other: HTML5 Canvas for rendering, File API for uploads, no external servers required.
•  No Training Required: Effects work with one photo/audio (zero/few-shot); keep it lightweight for browser (models <100MB, auto-download on load).
•  Edge Cases: Handle permissions (mic/cam), low-res inputs, browser compatibility issues. Include fallback for non-GPU devices (e.g., simpler filters).
•  Ethical Safeguards: Add a startup disclaimer: ‘For fun pranks only; get consent and don’t use for harm. Outputs are altered content.’
•  Performance: Optimize for 2025 browsers; test on mid-range hardware (no GPU needed, use CPU/WebGL fallback).
•  Deliverables: Provide the full source code (as a Replit project or zip), a live demo URL (hosted on Replit), step-by-step setup/run instructions, and a demo video/gif showing it in action (e.g., uploading a photo, applying effects, recording audio, and exporting a prank clip).
Make this 100% functional and bug-free—test thoroughly in multiple browsers before delivering. If any part can’t be implemented exactly (e.g., due to browser limits on heavy AI), explain why and suggest lightweight alternatives.”
